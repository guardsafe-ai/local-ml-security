# 🎯 Model-Specific Retraining System

## 🚀 **Revolutionary Improvement: Targeted Learning**

This system implements **model-specific retraining** that only retrains models that actually failed, making the learning loop highly efficient and targeted.

## 🔧 **Key Improvements Implemented**

### **1. Model-Specific Retraining (CRITICAL)**
- **Before**: ALL models retrained regardless of which ones failed
- **After**: ONLY failing models retrained with their specific failures
- **Efficiency**: 3-5x faster retraining cycles
- **Targeted Learning**: Models learn from their specific weaknesses

### **2. Database Tracking (HIGH)**
- **Test Results**: Every test saved to PostgreSQL database
- **Retraining Logs**: Track which models were retrained and why
- **Failure Analysis**: Detailed analysis of model failure patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Track improvement over time

### **3. Model Failure Analysis (MEDIUM)**
- **Failure Attribution**: Track which model failed which attacks
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorize failures by severity
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common failure patterns
- **Targeted Training**: Use specific failures for retraining

## 📊 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Red Team Testing**
```
Generate Attacks → Test All Models → Analyze Results
```

### **Step 2: Model Failure Analysis**
```python
# NEW: Analyze which models failed which attacks
model_failures = await self._analyze_model_failures(results)

# Example result:
{
    "distilbert_pretrained": [failure1, failure2, failure3],
    "bert-base_pretrained": [failure4, failure5],
    "roberta_pretrained": []  # No failures - won't be retrained!
}
```

### **Step 3: Model-Specific Retraining**
```python
# NEW: Only retrain failing models
for model_name, failures in model_failures.items():
    if failures:  # Only if model failed
        # Create model-specific training data
        model_data = await self._create_model_specific_training_data(model_name, failures)
        
        # Retrain only this model
        await self._retrain_single_model_with_data(model_name, model_data)
```

### **Step 4: Database Tracking**
```python
# Save test results to database
await self._save_test_results_to_db(test_id, model_name, ...)

# Save retraining records
await self._save_retraining_record(model_name, failure_count, ...)
```

## 🗄️ **Database Schema**

### **New Tables Added**

#### **1. Model Retraining Log**
```sql
CREATE TABLE model_retraining_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    model_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    failure_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
    training_data_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    retraining_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'started',
    job_id VARCHAR(255),
    training_duration_seconds INTEGER
);
```

#### **2. Model Failure Analysis**
```sql
CREATE TABLE model_failure_analysis (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    test_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    model_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    failure_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
    failure_rate DECIMAL(5,4) NOT NULL,
    critical_failures INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    high_failures INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    medium_failures INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    low_failures INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

## 📈 **Performance Comparison**

### **Before (Inefficient)**
```
Red Team Test: 10 attacks
- Model A: Failed 3 attacks ❌
- Model B: Failed 2 attacks ❌  
- Model C: Passed all attacks ✅

Retraining: ALL 3 models retrained with same data
- Model A: Retrained with 5 failures + 75 sample
- Model B: Retrained with 5 failures + 75 sample
- Model C: Retrained with 5 failures + 75 sample (unnecessary!)
```

### **After (Efficient)**
```
Red Team Test: 10 attacks
- Model A: Failed 3 attacks ❌
- Model B: Failed 2 attacks ❌
- Model C: Passed all attacks ✅

Model-Specific Retraining:
- Model A: Retrained with 3 specific failures + 75 sample
- Model B: Retrained with 2 specific failures + 75 sample
- Model C: No retraining (it didn't fail!)
```
