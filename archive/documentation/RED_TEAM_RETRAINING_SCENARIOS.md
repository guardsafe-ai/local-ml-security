# 🔄 Red Team Retraining Scenarios Analysis

## 🎯 **Question: What Gets Retrained When Red Team Testing Fails?**

### **📊 Current Retraining Logic**

The system retrains **ALL AVAILABLE PRE-TRAINED MODELS** when the learning loop is triggered, regardless of which specific model failed the tests.

## 🔍 **Detailed Analysis**

### **1. Vulnerability Detection Logic**

```python
# In _continuous_testing_loop()
vulnerabilities = [r for r in results if not r.detected]
# vulnerabilities = attacks that were NOT detected by the model
```

**Key Point**: Only **undetected attacks** (vulnerabilities) are saved for retraining.

### **2. Learning Loop Trigger**

```python
# In _update_training_data()
self.vulnerability_count += len(vulnerabilities)

if self.enable_learning_loop and self.vulnerability_count >= self.retraining_threshold:
    await self._trigger_learning_loop()
```

**Trigger Conditions**:
- `vulnerability_count >= retraining_threshold` (default: 10)
- `enable_learning_loop = True`

### **3. What Gets Retrained**

```python
# In _retrain_all_models()
pretrained_models = [
    name for name, info in models.items() 
    if info.get('loaded', False) and 'pretrained' in name
]

# Retrain each model
for model_name in pretrained_models:
    base_name = model_name.replace('_pretrained', '')
    await self._retrain_single_model(base_name)
```

**Current Behavior**: **ALL PRE-TRAINED MODELS** get retrained, not just the failing ones.

## 📋 **Retraining Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Single Model Failure**
```
Red Team Tests → Model A fails (5 vulnerabilities) → Model B passes (0 vulnerabilities)
Result: BOTH Model A and Model B get retrained with the same data
```

### **Scenario 2: Multiple Model Failures**
```
Red Team Tests → Model A fails (3 vulnerabilities) → Model B fails (2 vulnerabilities)
Result: BOTH Model A and Model B get retrained with combined data (5 vulnerabilities)
```

### **Scenario 3: All Models Pass**
```
Red Team Tests → All models pass (0 vulnerabilities)
Result: NO retraining triggered (vulnerability_count = 0)
```

### **Scenario 4: Partial Failures**
```
Red Team Tests → Model A fails (2 vulnerabilities) → Model B fails (3 vulnerabilities) → Model C passes (0 vulnerabilities)
Result: ALL THREE models get retrained with combined data (5 vulnerabilities)
```

## 🚨 **Current Issues**

### **1. Inefficient Retraining**
- **Problem**: All models retrained even if only one failed
- **Waste**: Resources spent retraining models that didn't fail
- **Time**: Longer retraining cycles

### **2. No Model-Specific Learning**
- **Problem**: Can't target specific model weaknesses
- **Result**: Generic retraining for all models

### **3. No Failure Attribution**
- **Problem**: Can't track which model failed which attacks
- **Result**: All models get same training data

## 🛠️ **Proposed Improvements**

### **Option 1: Model-Specific Retraining**
```python
async def _retrain_failing_models(self, vulnerabilities: List[AttackResult]):
    """Retrain only models that failed specific attacks"""
    
    # Group vulnerabilities by model that failed them
    model_failures = {}
    for vuln in vulnerabilities:
        for endpoint, result in vuln.model_results.items():
            if result.get('prediction') == 'benign':  # Model failed to detect
                model_name = self._extract_model_name(endpoint)
                if model_name not in model_failures:
                    model_failures[model_name] = []
                model_failures[model_name].append(vuln)
    
    # Retrain only failing models with their specific failures
    for model_name, failures in model_failures.items():
        await self._retrain_single_model_with_data(model_name, failures)
```

### **Option 2: Selective Retraining**
```python
async def _retrain_selective_models(self, vulnerabilities: List[AttackResult]):
    """Retrain models based on failure patterns"""
    
    # Analyze failure patterns
    failure_analysis = self._analyze_failure_patterns(vulnerabilities)
    
    # Retrain models with high failure rates
    high_failure_models = [
        model for model, rate in failure_analysis.items() 
        if rate > 0.5  # 50% failure rate threshold
    ]
    
    for model_name in high_failure_models:
        await self._retrain_single_model(model_name)
```

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
```python
async def _retrain_hybrid_approach(self, vulnerabilities: List[AttackResult]):
    """Hybrid retraining: specific + general"""
    
    # 1. Retrain models with specific failures
    await self._retrain_failing_models(vulnerabilities)
    
    # 2. If many models failed, retrain all for general improvement
    if len(vulnerabilities) > self.retraining_threshold * 0.8:
        await self._retrain_all_models()
```

## 📊 **Data Used for Retraining**

### **Current Data Sources**
1. **Red Team Vulnerabilities**: Only undetected attacks
2. **Sample Data**: Static examples (75 examples)
3. **Combined Data**: Red team + sample data

### **Data Selection Logic**
```python
# Only vulnerabilities (undetected attacks) are saved
vulnerabilities = [r for r in results if not r.detected]

# These get combined with sample data
combined_data = red_team_vulnerabilities + sample_data
```

## 🎯 **Answers to Your Questions**

### **Q: If red team training fails or few prompts aren't passed well or remain undetected, does only that get trained again with new data or whole?**

### **A: CURRENT BEHAVIOR - WHOLE SYSTEM RETRAINS**

**What happens now:**
1. **Only undetected attacks** (vulnerabilities) are saved for retraining
2. **ALL PRE-TRAINED MODELS** get retrained with the same combined data
3. **No model-specific targeting** - all models get same training data

**Example:**
```
Red Team Test Results:
- Model A: Failed 3 attacks (vulnerabilities)
- Model B: Failed 2 attacks (vulnerabilities)  
- Model C: Passed all attacks (0 vulnerabilities)

Retraining Triggered: vulnerability_count = 5 >= threshold = 10? No, but let's say yes

What Gets Retrained:
- Model A: Retrained with 5 vulnerabilities + 75 sample data
- Model B: Retrained with 5 vulnerabilities + 75 sample data
- Model C: Retrained with 5 vulnerabilities + 75 sample data (even though it didn't fail!)
```

### **B: IMPROVED BEHAVIOR - SELECTIVE RETRAINING**

**What should happen:**
1. **Track which model failed which attacks**
2. **Retrain only failing models** with their specific failures
3. **Model-specific training data** based on failure patterns

**Example:**
```
Red Team Test Results:
- Model A: Failed 3 attacks (vulnerabilities A1, A2, A3)
- Model B: Failed 2 attacks (vulnerabilities B1, B2)
- Model C: Passed all attacks (0 vulnerabilities)

Selective Retraining:
- Model A: Retrained with vulnerabilities A1, A2, A3 + sample data
- Model B: Retrained with vulnerabilities B1, B2 + sample data  
- Model C: No retraining (it didn't fail)
```

## 🚀 **Recommendation**

**Implement Model-Specific Retraining** to make the system more efficient and targeted:

1. **Track model-specific failures**
2. **Retrain only failing models**
3. **Use model-specific training data**
4. **Reduce resource waste**
5. **Improve learning efficiency**

This would make the learning loop much more effective and efficient! 🎯
