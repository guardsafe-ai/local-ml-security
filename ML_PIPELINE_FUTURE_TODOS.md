# ML Pipeline - Future Enhancements

## Current Status âœ…
All critical ML pipeline issues have been resolved:
- [x] Model version loading fixed (loads v15 from Staging instead of v11 from Production)
- [x] Model performance drift detection implemented
- [x] Email notifications for drift alerts added
- [x] Drift detection integrated with trained models
- [x] End-to-end ML workflow working correctly

## Future Enhancements ðŸ“‹

### High Priority
- [ ] **Automatic Drift Detection**
  - [ ] Scheduled drift detection (every 6 hours)
  - [ ] Real-time monitoring (every 100 predictions)
  - [ ] Configurable thresholds for alerts
  - [ ] Background service for continuous monitoring

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Model Promotion Workflow**
  - [ ] Add `/models/promote` endpoint (Staging â†’ Production)
  - [ ] Automatic model loading when promoted
  - [ ] Model comparison before promotion
  - [ ] A/B testing between model versions

- [ ] **Production Prediction Feedback Loop**
  - [ ] Store production predictions with timestamps
  - [ ] Aggregate predictions for drift analysis
  - [ ] Compare production vs training performance
  - [ ] Real-time performance monitoring

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Advanced Monitoring**
  - [ ] Grafana dashboards for drift metrics
  - [ ] Slack/Teams integration for alerts
  - [ ] Model performance degradation alerts
  - [ ] Data quality monitoring

- [ ] **MLOps Enhancements**
  - [ ] Model versioning strategy
  - [ ] Automated model retraining pipeline
  - [ ] Model rollback capabilities
  - [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Current Drift Detection Status
- **Mode**: Manual triggers via API endpoints
- **Email Alerts**: âœ… Working (dummy mode, ready for real SMTP)
- **Model Integration**: âœ… Uses trained models for comparison
- **Statistical Tests**: âœ… KS test, Chi-square, PSI working

## API Endpoints Available
- `POST /drift/data-drift` - Detect data drift
- `POST /drift/model-performance-drift` - Compare model performance  
- `POST /drift/check-and-retrain` - Combined drift detection + auto-retraining
- `POST /drift/test-email` - Test email notifications

## Configuration
- Email notifications: Configure via environment variables
- Drift thresholds: Configurable in `DriftConfig`
- Model versions: Support for explicit version loading
